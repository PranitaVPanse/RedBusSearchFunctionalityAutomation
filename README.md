- ChromeDriver - WebDriver implementation for launching and controlling the Chrome browser
- Maven - Project management tool used to handle dependencies and build the project
- Git - Version control to track and manage code changes

## Objective:<br/>
Automate RedBus Bus Search and Result Extraction using Selenium WebDriver and Java.
Simulate a real user journey on https://www.redbus.in, starting from selecting cities to printing all the available bus operators after applying some filters.

## Instructions: <br/>

- Launch the Chrome browser.
- Navigate to: https://www.redbus.in

- Select Source Location (From):

Handle Lazy Loading â€“ Scroll Until End of List:

- Ensure all buses are loaded (handle lazy loading logic).

Extract and Print Bus Operator Names:
- After fully loading the list, extract the names of all visible bus operators.
- Print each operator's name.

Finally, print the total number of buses available after filtering.

## Expected Outcome: <br/>
- Your program should search the buses from Mumbai to Pune
- Select the filters as Primo and Evening
- Perform the scrolling of the list
- Capture the buses' names and print them on the console
